**Non-Statistical Indicator**

The City of Los Angeles has an electronic land information system in place that keeps records of all parcels in the City. The Zone Information and Map Access System (ZIMAS) (zimas.lacity.org) records zoning, land use, ownership, and permit request information for the entire City. The Assessor Parcel Number allows for consistent record keeping for all parcels.
